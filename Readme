a simple node app which displays current time.
a static page index.html will call the '/date' route in the server.
the server will return the current timestamp.

to run locally:
    node server.js
    goto localhost:3000

github actions deploy to heroku:
    make sure the api key in the github repo matches the heroku key
    the app will be deployed to heroku automatically whenever there is a push to github
